# VBA && Excel

This file VBA_Excel contains a macro that names all existing Sheets in the file with the following scheme : sequence number _ name of the current month.
The macro is universal and works correctly in a file regardless of the number of Sheets.
I have also written a macro in the file which returns to the initial state, i.e. to the names before the change, but this only works if the number of sheets is the same as at the beginning.
In addition to VBA, the file also contains tasks from Excel itself and pivot tables.

Another macro in the folder named macro 2 transfers data from multiple Excel files from the Data folder to a single master file named MasterFile.xlsm.
The values of the individual files can be changed and updated on the fly and each time the macro is pressed in the master file all the information will be updated as well.
